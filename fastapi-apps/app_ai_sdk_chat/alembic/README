Generic single-database configuration with async SQLAlchemy.

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for the application.

## Creating Migrations

To create a new migration:

    make migrate-create MSG="Add new table"

## Applying Migrations

To apply all pending migrations:

    make migrate-upgrade

## Checking Status

To see current migration status:

    make migrate

## Downgrading

To downgrade one migration:

    make migrate-downgrade

To downgrade to a specific revision:

    make migrate-downgrade-to REV='revision_id'

## Notes

- Each app uses its own version table (alembic_version_app_ai_sdk_chat)
- Migrations use system environment variables for database connection
- Import all models in app/models/__init__.py for autogenerate to detect them
